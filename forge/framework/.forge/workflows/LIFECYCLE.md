# FORGE Lifecycle

The default product-development flow is:

```text
IDEA → DISCOVER → RESEARCH → DEFINE → ARCHITECT → DESIGN → BUILD → SECURE → TEST → VERIFY → DEPLOY → IMPROVE
```

Each stage has four parts:

1. Inputs: what must already be known.
2. Actions: what the agent should do.
3. Outputs: what becomes project context or an implementation artifact.
4. Exit conditions: what must be true before moving forward.

## Delivery protocol

Implementation work also follows `.forge/workflows/GIT.md` unless the repository's own policy is stricter.

```text
MATERIAL WORK
    ↓
ISSUE / TRACKED INTENT
    ↓
DEDICATED BRANCH
    ↓
IMPLEMENT
    ↓
VERIFY
    ↓
PULL REQUEST
    ↓
REVIEW + CI
    ↓
MERGE
    ↓
UPDATE CONTEXT / README / STATE
```

## Reasoning economy

At every stage, follow `.forge/policies/AI-EFFICIENCY.md`: use stored context and deterministic tooling before spending model effort, load only relevant intelligence, and escalate reasoning when uncertainty or risk justifies it.

## Readme initialization

For a new product, the README should be initialized during the early planning/architecture stage from verified product context and the appropriate `.forge/templates/readme/` pattern. It is then maintained as product reality changes.

## Proportionality

FORGE may shorten or expand the lifecycle for a task. It must not skip a stage silently when that stage contains a material product, market, technical, security, design, or quality decision.
